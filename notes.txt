Project Overview

The goal of this project is create a responsive, personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
This will be used as my online portfolio that I can show to potential employers to showcase my experience.
The website must contain interactive elements that showcase previous projects and work that is relevant to the Software Development industry.
To begin with this website will have 3 pages, the home page/introduction, projects page, and contact information page including links to LinkedIn and GitHub pages.
SEO principles must be implemented into the meta information as well as releveant title and description.
The portfolio should have a user-friendly interface that makes it simple for visitors to switch between different sections and quickly find the data they require.
Search and filtering should be available so that users can quickly find particular projects or skills. Additionally, a filter function could be used to group and order projects according to
various factors like date, field, or applied skill.
Implementing a contact form will allow site visitors to submit requests or messages while collecting crucial data like name, email address, and the message's content.
The platform should enable the integration of different media types, such as pictures, videos, and documents, to display the user's work.
